# TickTickSync

The TickTickSync plugin automatically creates tasks in ticktick and synchronizes task state between Obsidian and ticktick.

The plugin works best when the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin is installed.

## Features

- Any task created in Obsidian and taged with #ticktick will be synchronized with TickTick
- Any task created in TickTick will be synchronized to Obisidian.
- Updates are bi-directional
- Tasks added or updated from Obsidian are synched to TickTick immediately.
- Tasks added or updated from TickTick are synched on a configurable time interval.

## Notes

1.  TickTick lists are referred to as Projects in the plugin, and throughout documentation.
2.  TickTick only has four priorities (High, Medium, Low, None). Please see Priority in [Task Format](#Task-format) for Task mapping of priority
3.  **Warning:** TickTickSync automatically creates .md files corresponding with the lists/projects created in TickTick and downloads all tasks to them.  
    If the files are deleted in Obsidian while the TickTickSync plugin is active, those tasks will be deleted.  
    To recover those tasks, go to the "Trash" menu item on the TickTick interface and recover deleted tasks from there.
4.  Please see known issue 3. below. **Strongly** recommend using subtasks rather than items to avoid loss of data.

## Known Issues

1.  Currently, ALL TickTick tasks are synched. Depending on feedback, may add a tag on the TickTick side. ie: If tagged with #obisidian a task will be synched. If not, it will be ignored.
2.  The plugin only works with the [Tasks emoji formats](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Task+Formats/About+Task+Formats). It will **not** work with the Dataview format. In the fullness of time, this plugin will be refactored to use Tasks functionality to support both.
3.  Descriptions are no longer overwritten, the Obsidian URL is added to title. Task Items are downloaded. But full update is not supported. Yet.
4.  ~**Description warning**: Currently, a link to the vault and file in the vault are saved in the Description field. Meaning that any items or descriptions will be over-written during synchronization~
    1.  ~How this will be handled will be determined by feedback from users.~
5.  Have only tested in one time zone. Not sure if cross time zone tasks will work, or if TickTick's time zone implementations will be handled.
6.  Due Date:
    1.  On the Obsidian side: if no time is provided, the start time will default to 08:00
    2.  On the TickTick side: if not time is provided, the start time will be 00:00
7.  Parent/Child tasks are supported bi-directionally. However, changes to the parent/child relationship are not handled. Yet.
8.  Moving tasks between Projects/Lists is unsupported at this time.
9.  Because Tags can't have spaces, at this time it is not possible to add a task to a project with name that contains spaces. In the fullness of time, will implement some kind of workaround (eg: `#folder_with_a_space` will be converted to `folder with a space`)
10. If a file has a default project association (see settings), it is possible to create a task with project tag other than the default project. The Task will be correctly synched to TickTick in the correct folder. However, if the Task is then updated with subtasks, from TickTick, the subtasks will be synched to the project's default file rather than the file where the original parent task was created.

## Installation

### From within Obsidian

From Obsidian v1.3.5+, you can activate this plugin within Obsidian by doing the following:

1.  Open Obsidian's `Settings` window
2.  Select the `Community plugins` tab on the left
3.  Make sure `Restricted mode` is **off**
4.  Click `Browse` next to `Community Plugins`
5.  Search for and click on `TickTickSync`
6.  Click `Install`
7.  Once installed, close the `Community Plugins` window
8.  Under `Installed Plugins`, activate the `TickTickSync` plugin

You can update the plugin following the same procedure, clicking `Update` instead of `Install`

### BRAT

1.  Install from Community Plugins [Obsidian42 - BRAT](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian42-brat) (latest)
    - See [their readme](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat#readme).
2.  Follow the instructions to add the plugin from: https://github.com/thesamim/TickTickSync

### Manually

If you would rather install the plugin manually, you can do the following:

1.  Download the latest release of the plugin from the [Releases](https://github.com/thesamim/TickTickSync/releases) page.
2.  Extract the downloaded zip file and copy the entire folder to your Obsidian plugins directory.
3.  Enable the plugin in the Obsidian settings.

## Configuration

1.  Open Obsidian's `Settings` window
2.  Select the `Community plugins` tab on the left
3.  Under `Installed plugins`, click the gear icon next to the `TickTickSync` plugin
4.  Enter your TickTick user ID and Password.

## Settings

1.  Automatic synchronization interval time  
    The time interval for automatic synchronization is set to 300 seconds by default, which means it runs every 5 minutes. You can modify it yourself.
2.  Default project  
    New tasks will be added to the default project, and you can change the default project in the settings.
3.  Full vault sync  
    By enabling this option, the plugin will automatically add `#ticktick` to all tasks, which will modify all files in the vault.

TickTick only has three priority levels. They are mapped as follows.

| TickTick | Obsidian |
| -------- | -------- |
| 0        | null     |
| 0        | '‚è¨'     |
| 1        | 'üîΩ'     |
| 3        | 'üîº'     |
| 5        | '‚è´'     |
| 5        | 'üî∫'     |

| `- [ ] task ‚è´ #ticktick` |

### Set a default project for each file separately

The default project in the setting applies to all files. You can set a separate default project for each file using command.

![](/attachment/command-set-default-project-for-file.png) ![](/attachment/default-project-for-file-modal.png)

You can see the current file's default project in the status bar at the bottom right corner.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin is based on [Ultimate Todoist Sync for Obsidian](https://github.com/HeroBlackInk/ultimate-todoist-sync-for-obsidian).  
There have been significant changes due to the difference between TickTick and ToDoist task handling. I am grateful for the work that [HeroBlackInk](https://github.com/HeroBlackInk/ultimate-todoist-sync-for-obsidian/commits?author=HeroBlackInk) put it in to the original plugin.

The [TickTick api wrapper](https://github.com/thesamim/ticktick-api-lvt) used here is forked from https://github.com/lucasvtiradentes/ticktick-api-lvt. Thanks to [Lucas](https://github.com/lucasvtiradentes) for his support.
