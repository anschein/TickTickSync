# TickTickSync

The TickTickSync plugin automatically creates tasks in ticktick and synchronizes task state between Obsidian and ticktick.

The plugin works best when the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin is installed.

## Features

- Any task created in Obsidian and taged with #ticktick will be synchronized with TickTick
- Any task created in TickTick will be synchronized to Obisidian.
- Updates are bi-directional
- Tasks added or updated from Obsidian are synched to TickTick immediately.
- Tasks added or updated from TickTick are synched on a configurable time interval.

## Notes

1. **All Task Deletion operations must be confirmed.** In the fullness of time, when we get out of Beta, this might be a preference item. For now it's compulsory.
2. TickTick lists are referred to as Projects in the plugin, and throughout documentation.
3. TickTick only has four priorities (High, Medium, Low, None). Please see Priority in [Task Format](#task-format) for Task mapping of priority
4. **Warning:** TickTickSync automatically creates .md files corresponding with the lists/projects created in TickTick and downloads all tasks to them.  
   If the files are deleted in Obsidian while the TickTickSync plugin is active, those tasks will be deleted. If you accidentally confirm that deletion: 
   To recover those tasks, go to the "Trash" menu item on the TickTick interface and recover deleted tasks from there.
5. TickTickSync now supports Task Items and will **NOT** delete Task Content. However, as of now, it will not allow management of Task Content.
6. A link to the containing file in Obsidian is added to the Task Title in TickTick, but the content field is not mangled. In the fullness of time content will be manageable in TickTickSync. Please watch this [issue](https://github.com/thesamim/TickTickSync/issues/10) for progress. 
7. Relatively confident that Time Zone difference issues are resolved. If not: Please open an issue with details.

## Known Issues

1. Apparently TickTick has changed sign in procedures. TickTick sometimes requires the user login with a captcha. A temporary work-around: You will have to login manually from settings. Theoretically, this take takes care of the issue.
2. Currently, ALL TickTick tasks are synched. This [issue](https://github.com/thesamim/TickTickSync/issues/7) tracks the resolution: If tagged with #obisidian a task will be synched. If not, it will be ignored.
3. The plugin only works with the [Tasks emoji formats](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Task+Formats/About+Task+Formats). It will **not** work with the Dataview format. In the fullness of time, this plugin will be refactored to use Tasks functionality to support both.
4. Due Date:
   1. On the Obsidian side: if no time is provided, the start time will default to 08:00
   2. On the TickTick side: if not time is provided, the start time will be 00:00
   3. The [Tasks plugin](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) queries will not find TickTickSync Tasks because the dates are not positioned per [Tasks Format](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Auto-Suggest#What+do+I+need+to+know+about+the+order+of+items+in+a+task%3F)  
5. Parent/Child tasks are supported bi-directionally. However, changes to the parent/child relationship are not handled. Yet.
6. Moving tasks between Projects/Lists is **NOT** supported at this time.
7. Because Tags can't have spaces, at this time it is not possible to add a task to a project with name that contains spaces. In the fullness of time, will implement some kind of workaround (eg: `#folder_with_a_space` will be converted to `folder with a space`)
8. If a file has a default project association (see settings), it is possible to create a task with project tag other than the default project. The Task will be correctly synched to TickTick in the correct folder. However, if the Task is then updated with subtasks, from TickTick, the subtasks will be synched to the project's default file rather than the file where the original parent task was created.

3.  Full vault sync  
    By enabling this option, the plugin will automatically add `#ticktick` to all tasks, which will modify all files in the vault.

### Set a default project for each file separately

The default project in the setting applies to all files. You can set a separate default project for each file using command.

![](/attachment/command-set-default-project-for-file.png) ![](/attachment/default-project-for-file-modal.png)

You can see the current file's default project in the status bar at the bottom right corner.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin is based on [Ultimate Todoist Sync for Obsidian](https://github.com/HeroBlackInk/ultimate-todoist-sync-for-obsidian).  
There have been significant changes due to the difference between TickTick and ToDoist task handling. I am grateful for the work that [HeroBlackInk](https://github.com/HeroBlackInk/ultimate-todoist-sync-for-obsidian/commits?author=HeroBlackInk) put it in to the original plugin.

The [TickTick api wrapper](https://github.com/thesamim/ticktick-api-lvt) used here is forked from https://github.com/lucasvtiradentes/ticktick-api-lvt. Thanks to [Lucas](https://github.com/lucasvtiradentes) for his support.
